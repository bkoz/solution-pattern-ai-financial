= Architecture 

Introduction for the architecture of this solution pattern.

== Common Challenges 

- Capturing near real-time stock exchange. The makes periodic fine tuning
of large language models prohibitive. 

- Hosting AI services such as vector database and LLMs to address security
and privacy concerns.

== An in-depth look at the solution's architecture

A closer look at the services and components that make up this solution pattern.

=== Data Flow 

image::dataflow.jpg[width=100%]

Data flow begins at the source with stock information made available 
via a RESTful API service hosted by Alpha Vantage. An ingest engine consisting
of two Camel services take care of keeping the data fresh in the Weaviate
vector database. The ingest processes are highly configurable and perform
filtering and discarding of invalid or null data.

=== Architecture

The heart of the architecture is a Weaviate vector
database.
